## Installing

Currently, there are no prebuilt extensions, and it is not available on the Chrome web store. You can build it yourself, though.

First step is to clone this repository.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions` and select "Load unpacked extension" and select the directory that you cloned this repository into.

Congrats. Your new tabs look nice now!
