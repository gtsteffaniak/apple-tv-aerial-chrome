# Apple tv aerial wallpaper

Recently, the official chrome store extension for apple tv aerial became the another victim of google's helicopter parent tactics. They pulled it for "tracking" users. Either way, here's an open-source clone.

## Installing

Currently, there are no prebuilt extensions, and it is not available on the Chrome web store. You can build it yourself, though.

First step is to clone this repository.

In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions` and select "Load unpacked extension" and select the directory that you cloned this repository into.

Congrats. Your new tabs look nice now!

## Credits and Inspiration

I got the links from [Benjamin Mayo's cool site](http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/watch-all-the-apple-tv-aerial-video-screensavers)

I took inspiration from [Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial), which makes these videos MacOS screensavers.
